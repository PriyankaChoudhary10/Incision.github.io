            <p>
                Most modern browsers allow you to control your cookie settings for all websites
                that you browse. You can disable cookie deployment completely by editing your browser
                settings, however in doing this you may be limiting the functionality that is displayed
                on our website. To learn how to disable cookies on your preferred browser we recommend
                reading <a href="http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=61416"

                If you are concerned about cookies tracking your movements on the Internet then
                you may be concerned about spyware. Spyware is the name given to a particular band
                of cookies that track personal information about you. There are many antispyware
                programs that you can use to prevent this from happening. Learn more about antispyware
