                                    Yes. The Incision limits exceed the private hospital groups’ requirements, with
                                    cover up to £20,000,000 for any one claim and £40,000,000 for each individual in
                                    the annual aggregate. Most hospital groups request that their consultants carry
                                    a minimum limit of indemnity of £10,000,000 for any one claim and in the annual

                                    Your Incision policy is a contract underwritten on a “Claims Made” basis. This means
                                    that the policy will provide cover for any claims or circumstances that are reported
                                    to, and accepted by, underwriters during the policy period. It is for this reason
                                    all of our surgeons are encouraged to notify any adverse incidents as soon as possible,
                                    because if a claim or circumstance is reported within the policy period, it is deemed
                                    notified by Underwriters and therefore covered (subject to the terms and conditions
                                    of the policy).</p>

                                    (ERP), sometimes called Run Off, which is triggered on the expiry of your policy
                                    in the event of death, permanent disablement and permanent retirement and this is

                                    who regularly treat professional sports people. SEMPRIS understand first-hand the
